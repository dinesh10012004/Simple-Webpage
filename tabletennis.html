        <p>Table tennis, also known as ping pong, is a fast-paced and highly strategic sport played indoors. It is
            characterized by quick rallies, precise ball control, and lightning-fast reflexes. Table tennis is played
            on a rectangular table divided by a net, with players using paddles to hit a lightweight ball back and
            forth across the table.</p>

        <p>The game can be played as singles (one player on each side) or doubles (two players on each side). Points
            are scored when one player fails to return the ball within the rules. Table tennis requires a combination
            of hand-eye coordination, agility, and strategic thinking, making it an engaging and entertaining sport for
            players and spectators alike.</p>

        <p>Table tennis is played at both recreational and competitive levels, with international tournaments and the
            Olympic Games featuring some of the world's best players. The sport is known for its inclusivity,
            allowing players of all ages and skill levels to enjoy the game.</p>

        <p>Table tennis tables can be found in community centers, schools, and homes around the world, making it
            accessible to a wide audience. The sport encourages friendly competition, improves reflexes, and provides a
            fun way to stay active and socialize.</p>
