        <p>Volleyball is an exciting team sport played on a rectangular court divided by a net. The objective is to
            score points by sending the ball over the net and into the opponent's court in a way that prevents them
            from returning it. It is known for its fast-paced rallies, quick thinking, and dynamic teamwork.</p>

        <p>Each team consists of six players, and the game starts with a serve. Players use a combination of
            bumping/passing, setting, and spiking/hitting to keep the ball in play and strategically outmaneuver the
            opposing team. Volleyball matches are typically played in a best-of-five set format, with each set
            requiring 25 points to win (with some variations).</p>

        <p>Volleyball is played both indoors and on the beach, with variations in rules and court size. It is a sport
            that demands agility, coordination, and communication among team members. The libero, a specialized
            defensive player, often plays a crucial role in receiving and digging the ball.</p>

        <p>The sport is popular worldwide, with international competitions, such as the Olympic Games and World
            Championships, showcasing elite talent. Volleyball is not only a competitive sport but also a popular
            recreational activity enjoyed in schools, parks, and beach settings, promoting fitness and social
            interaction.</p>
