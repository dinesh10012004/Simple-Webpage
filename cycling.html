        <p>Cycling is a popular recreational activity and competitive sport that involves riding bicycles for various
            purposes, including commuting, fitness, and competition. It is an environmentally friendly and
            health-promoting activity enjoyed by people of all ages around the world.</p>

        <p>There are various forms of cycling, such as road cycling, mountain biking, track cycling, and BMX. Road
            cycling involves riding on paved roads, often covering long distances, while mountain biking takes riders
            off-road, tackling challenging terrains and trails. Track cycling is performed on specialized indoor
            tracks, and BMX involves racing on small dirt tracks with jumps and obstacles.</p>

        <p>Cycling is not only an excellent cardiovascular exercise but also a sustainable and efficient means of
            transportation. Many communities promote cycling as a green alternative for commuting, reducing
            environmental impact and promoting a healthy lifestyle.</p>

        <p>Competitive cycling events, such as the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, and the Olympic cycling
            competitions, attract global attention and showcase the endurance, speed, and technical skills of elite
            cyclists. Whether for leisure or competition, cycling offers a sense of freedom, exploration, and
            connection with the outdoors.</p>
