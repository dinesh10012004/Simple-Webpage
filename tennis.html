        <p>Tennis is a dynamic and exhilarating sport played on a rectangular court by two or four players (singles or
            doubles). It involves players using a racket to hit a ball over a net into the opponent's court, with the
            goal of scoring points. Tennis is known for its fast-paced rallies, strategic gameplay, and competitive
            spirit.</p>

        <p>The court is divided into two halves, and players take turns serving and returning the ball. Points are
            scored based on the opponent's failure to return the ball within the designated boundaries. The sport
            requires a combination of skill, agility, endurance, and mental focus.</p>

        <p>Tennis is played on various surfaces, including clay, grass, and hard courts, each affecting the game's
            dynamics. Major tennis tournaments, such as Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open, and the Australian
            Open, attract global attention and feature some of the world's best players competing for prestigious
            titles.</p>

        <p>Beyond its competitive aspect, tennis is enjoyed by millions of recreational players worldwide. It promotes
            physical fitness, social interaction, and sportsmanship. Tennis is a versatile sport suitable for all ages
            and skill levels, providing a lifelong opportunity for enjoyment and improvement.</p>
