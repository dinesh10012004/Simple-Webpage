        <p>Cricket is a globally popular sport known for its strategic gameplay, skilled athleticism, and rich
            traditions.
            It is played between two teams, each consisting of eleven players, on a circular field with a rectangular
            22-yard pitch in the center.</p>

        <p>The primary objective in cricket is to score runs by hitting the ball with a bat and running between the
            wickets or hitting boundaries. The opposing team tries to dismiss the batsmen and limit the number of
            runs
            scored. Cricket matches can take various formats, including Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs),
            and
            Twenty20 (T20) matches.</p>

        <p>Cricket has a rich history and is deeply ingrained in the cultures of many countries, especially in
            countries
            like India, England, Australia, and Pakistan. International competitions, such as the ICC Cricket World
            Cup,
            bring together teams from around the world to compete for cricket's most prestigious title.</p>

        <p>The sport has evolved over the years, introducing new formats, technologies like Decision Review System
            (DRS),
            and captivating fans with thrilling moments, such as sixes, wickets, and close finishes. Cricket also
            fosters
            a sense of sportsmanship, teamwork, and camaraderie among players.</p>
